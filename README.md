# Urban PM2.5 Concentration Analysis



## **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on retrieving, cleaning, and exploring real-world data on **annual mean PM2.5 concentrations** in urban areas across different countries. The dataset provides a population-weighted average of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in cities, which is a critical indicator of environmental health risk.

You will simulate an end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) process, aligning with the following objectives:
- Retrieve and load the data from CSV, JSON, and/or remote sources.
- Clean the data by managing missing values and identifying outliers using statistical techniques.
- Use residual-based methods to flag anomalies.
- Document your process in Jupyter Notebooks and build an interactive Streamlit dashboard for reporting findings.

This project mirrors a professional workflow you'd follow in data science consulting or research to prepare high-quality environmental data for downstream ML tasks or policy analysis.




The final product includes:
- A step-by-step data analysis notebook for technical users
- A Streamlit dashboard app for non-technical users and policymakers

### Full meta data:
```
Indicator name:
Annual mean concentration of particulate matter of less than 2.5 microns of diameter (PM2.5) [ug/m3] in urban areas
Short name:
Annual mean PM2.5 concentration in urban areas
Data type:
Statistic
Indicator Id:
4674
Topic:
Risk factors
ISO Health Indicators Framework
Environmental factors
Rationale:
Air pollution consists of many pollutants, among other particulate matter. These particles are able to penetrate deeply into the respiratory tract and therefore constitute a risk for health by increasing mortality from respiratory infections and diseases, lung cancer, and selected cardiovascular diseases.
Definition:
The mean annual concentration of fine suspended particles of less than 2.5 microns in diameters is a common measure of air pollution. The mean is a population-weighted average for urban population in a country.
Method of measurement
Concentration of PM2.5 are regularly measured from fixed-site,  population-oriented monitors located within the metropolitan areas. High-quality measurements of PM concentration from all the monitors in the metropolitan area can be averaged to develop a single estimate.  
Method of estimation:
Although PM is measured at many thousands of locations throughout the world, the amount of monitors in different geographical areas vary, with some areas having little or no monitoring. In order to produce global estimates at high resolution (0.1◦ grid‐cells), additional data is required. Annual urban mean concentration of PM2.5 is estimated with improved modelling using data integration from satellite remote sensing, population estimates, topography and ground measurements.
Preferred data sources:
Special studies
Expected frequency of data dissemination:
Every 2-3 years
Expected frequency of data collection:
Every 2-3 years

## 🧪 Testing and Validation

In large applications, we want to ensure that future developments don't change previous confirmed results. One way to perform this test is to run our codes on one same dataset after each development and make sure the results are not affected. 


✅ What is Tested In this Test:
- Missing value handling logic
- Outlier detection thresholds
- Data type and column consistency

🧪 Run Tests:
```bash
pytest tests/test_cleaning.py -v
```
